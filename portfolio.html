I manage the pharmacy digital team whose purpose is to manage and create digital software solutions for our users. <br>
 As the leader of this small team, I am the manager, UX designer, researcher, solutions architect, developer, product manager, front-end coder (HTML, CSS and JS) and the bridge between technical and operations. 
 I have many successful projects in use today ranging from web apps, websites, elearning, digital signage, robotics, radio frequency electronics and barcoding. This experience has allowed me to learn the importance of the User Experience (UX) design process and principles. <br>
The pharmacy digital team is responsible for 35 applications comprising a mixture of internal developed and off-the-shelf solutions held on five virtual servers. I am responsible for various digital kits and hardware including three pharmacy dispensing robots, RFID patient bedside lockers and electronic controlled drug cabinets. <br>
  I am an EPIC superuser and I was heavily involved in the design of various EPIC workstreams, including inventory, ambulatory and willow. I am the bridge between EPIC and pharmacy operational activity due to my technical knowledge and skill set.
  <br>  
The most recent project I have been working on is our new app platform I designed, coded, developed, tested and released. (click the image on the left) 
<br><br>
So what can I offer? <br>
I carefully craft comprehensive digital experiences that function consistently and seamlessly across all browsers. <br>
From desktop screens, to mobile phones and tablets, my websites and applications scale and adapt smoothly to the ever-changing context of multi-device users and interactions. <br>
I create digital solutions through five phases: Discovery, Prototyping, Testing, Iteration and Release. Person-centred design is key to producing a product that is pain-free, easy to use, meets the needs of the user and the business, therefore each stage is completed collaboratively with the users and stakeholders. <br> <br>

          <p class="card-text">

    I was seconded to London Pharmacy Education and Training to work on turning the accreditation in medicines management qualification into a blended learning model using the Moodle platform.
    For this project I used tools like the “big blue button” (virtual classroom) “Camtasia” (to create videos) and all the usual Moodle tools such as quizzes, assignments, books etc.

          <p class="card-text">With the introduction of a new EHRS system, our old backup labelling system would need to be replaced due to the aging technology
            used to develop it.
As the pharmacy digital manager my role in this project was front heavy with wire framing, researching, design and testing.
The backup label we have released works so well that users can produce a label within 1 minute with no directions, creating a pain free application to be used in the event of a stressful situation.
